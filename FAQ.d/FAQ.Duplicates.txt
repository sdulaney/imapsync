                Imapsync tips about duplicated messages issues.
======================================================================

=======================================================================
Q. How can I remove duplicates in an lone account?

R. Just run imapsync on the same account with option --delete2duplicates,
   ie, with host1 == host2 and user1 == user2

=======================================================================
Q: Multiple copies, duplicates, when I run imapsync twice ore more. 

R0. 
Normally and by default, imapsync doesn't generate duplicates.
So if it does  generate duplicates it means a problem occurs
with message identification. It happens sometimes with IMAP 
servers changing the "Message-Id" header line or one or more
of the "Received:" header lines in the header part of messages. 
Imapsync uses "Message-Id" header line and "Received:" header 
lines to identify messages on both sides.

R1. 
A first solution is to use option --useuid. 
With option --useuid, imapsync  doesn't use header lines 
to identify and compare messages in folders.
Instead of some headers,  --useuid tell imapsync to use 
the imap UIDs given by imap servers on bith sides.
To avoid duplicates on next runs, imapsync uses a local cache
where it keeps UIDs already transfered.

  imapsync ... --useuid

There is an issue when --useuid is not used the first time.
A big issue with --useuid is that it doesn't generate duplicates if 
used from the first time but it does generate duplicates after a previous
run without --useuid (because then uses a different method to identify 
the messages). 

A solution? Two solutions. 

The easiest is --delete2
if you are permitted to use it. Option --delete2 removes messages on host2
that are not on host1 so with --delete2 you go for resyncing all 
messages again but all previously transferred messages are deleted,
and also messages previously there without imapsync. 
So --useuid --delete2 is easy to remove duplicates but not for 
all context.

A second solution, better if R2 works (see R2 below), is to build 
the cache before using --useuid

First sync:

  imapsync ... --useheader "Message-Id" --addheader --usecache

Next syncs:

  imapsync ... --useuid
  imapsync ... --useuid
  ...

R2. 
Best way if you can follow it. 
Multiple copies of the emails on the destination server. Some IMAP
servers (Domino for example) change some headers for each message
transferred. All messages are transferred again and again each time you
run imapsync. This is bad of course. The explanation is that imapsync
considers messages are not the same on each side, default headers used
to identify the messages have changed.

You can look at the headers found by imapsync by using the --debug
option (and search for the message on both part), Header lines from
the source server begin with a "FH:" prefix, Header lines from the
destination server begin with a "TH:" prefix. Since --debug is very
verbose I suggest to isolate a email in a specific folder in case you
want to forward me the output.

A way to avoid this problem is by using option --useheader with
a different set than the default ones used by imapsync.

The default set is equivalent to:

  imapsync ... --useheader "Message-Id" --useheader "Received"

The problem now is that what can be used instead of Message-Id
and Received lines? Often standalone Message-Id works:

  imapsync ... --useheader "Message-Id"

Once imapsync does not generate duplicates, the previous duplicates
can be deleted with option --delete2duplicates

  imapsync ... --useheader "Message-Id" --delete2duplicates

Another good way toward a solution is to isolate two or three messages
in a BUG folder and send me the --debug output by email at
gilles.lamiral@laposte.net

  imapsync ... --debug  --folder BUG

I will take a close look at the log and modify imapsync to fix
this faulty duplicate behavior.

Remark. (Trick found by Tomasz Kaczmarski)

Option --useheader "Message-Id" asks the server to send only header
lines beginning with "Message-Id".  Some (buggy) servers send the whole
header (all lines) instead of the "Message-Id" line. In that case, a
trick to keep the --useheader filtering behaviour is to use
--skipheader with a negative lookahead pattern:

 imapsync ... --skipheader "^(?!Message-Id)"

 Read it as "skip every header except Message-Id".

=======================================================================
Q. imapsync calculates 479 messages in a folder but only transfers 400 
   messages. What's happen?

R1. Unless --useuid is used, imapsync considers a header part 
   of a message to identify a message on both sides.
   By default the header part used is lines "Message-Id:" "Message-ID:" 
   and "Received:" or specific lines depending on --useheader 
   --skipheader. Whole header can be set by --useheader ALL

Consequences:

  1) Duplicate messages on host1 (identical header) are not transferred.

The result is that you can have more messages on host1 than on host2.

R2. With option --useuid imapsync doesn't use headers to identify
    messages on both sides but it uses their imap uid identifier.
    In that case duplicates on host1 are also transferred on host2.
